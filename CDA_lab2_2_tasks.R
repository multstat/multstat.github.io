### Task 1. Keep the following variables: 
### polit: 1 - interested in politics, 0 - otherwise
### female: 1 - female, 0 - otherwise
### age: age measured in years
### income_average: family income in the previous month (in rubles)

### Task 2. Estimate the logistic regression model of "interested in politics" on the remaining variables
### If needed, you can transform the variables.  
### Interpret the coefficient estimates (use different methods: marginal effects, odds ratio, discrete change in probabilities)

### Task 3. Calculate McFadden pseudo-R2 to give a preliminary information about the model 

### Task 4. Run the Hosmer-Lemeshow test to compare observed and predicted values. 
### Make a conclusion 

### Task 5. Plot the ROC-curve. Interpret the AUC-value 

### Task 6. Classify your observations into two groups: 1 and 0.
### Choose the cutoff value by yourself. 
### Interpret Sensitivity, Specificity and Accuracy values.
### Is your model good in terms of prediction?
